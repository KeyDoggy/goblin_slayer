# goblin_slayer
2D pixel shooter game created using Python and Pygame. First coding project. Completed in high school along with Jordan Roswell

The goal of the game is to score as many points as you can. You gain points by shooting an enemy or by collecting a powerup
You can move the character left and right using the left and right arrow keys.
You jump by pressing the up arrow key. You shoot by pressing the space bar.
There are three types of enemies. The first type is the normal goblin. These goblins take one hit to kill.
The second type is the scientist goblin. These goblins can walk in the sky and have a shield, so they take two hits to kill.
The third type is the boss goblin. These goblins walk on the ground, but take 10 hits to kill, as indicated by the health bar above their heads.
Occasionally you may find a gun on the ground. By collecting this, all goblins currently on screen will die and you will gain 10 points.
When you get hit by any goblin you lose. You can click on play again to retry or quit to exit the game.
